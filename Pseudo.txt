# An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value,then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input

request a positive interger from user 
 if interger is equal to zero
  print largest number entered  

# An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average
  
request intergers from user 
 if intergers entered more than or equal to 5 
   print sum average of all integers entered
